#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void ascDecFunc(int a[], int n)
{
    sort(a, a+n);
    // printing first half in ascending order
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++)
      cout<<a[i]<<" "; 
    // printing second half in descending order
    for (int j = n - 1; j >= n / 2; j--)
      cout<<a[j]<<" ";
}

Mia just opened a new savings account with her local bank. To keep track of her transactions, she decided to write a simple C++ program to manage her account. The program helps her deposit money and ensures she maintains a minimum balance whenever she withdraws funds.
Create a class “BankAccount” with fields “accountNumber”, “balance” and a method “deposit()” that adds an amount to the balance.
Create a subclass “SavingsAccount” that extends “BankAccount” and adds a field “minimumBalance” and a method “withdraw()” that subtracts an amount from the balance. 

Create an object of the “SavingsAccount” class and call the “deposit()” and “withdraw()” methods.


Input Format
Values for banking!

Output Format
Balance.

Sample Input & Output:
Enter the Account Number: 123456
Enter the initial balance: 10000
Enter the minimum balance: 5000

Account Number: 123456
Balance: ₹10000
Enter the amount for deposit: 7500
Deposited: ₹7500
New balance: ₹17500

Enter the amount to withdraw: 13000
Withdrawal failed: Insufficient funds. Minimum balance must be maintained.

Write a program to implement the following logic using inheritance.
Create a parent class and implement the fun method. In the method, get the individual digits of the entered number, store it in an
array, and find their sum.
For example in case of 1234, the individual digits are 4,3,2,1 and the final sum → (4+3)+(4+2)+(4+1)+(3+2)+(3+1)+(2+1) = 30.

Create the main class that inherits the parent class and call the fun method inside the parent function.

Input Format
The input consists of an integer.
Output Format
The output prints the final sum.
Constraints
Integers only.

Sample Input
1234
Sample Output
30

Sarah is a mechanical engineer working on the design of various shapes for her company's manufacturing process. She needs to calculate the volume of different objects, including
cubes, rectangular boxes, and cylinders. To streamline the calculations, Sarah writes a C++ program that uses function overloading to compute the volume of these shapes with varying
numbers of arguments.
Function Overloading with Arguments:
Problem: Write a program that demonstrates the use of function overloading with different numbers of arguments. Create overloaded volume() functions in a class Volume to calculate the volume of:
A cube (single parameter: side length)
A rectangular box (three parameters: length, width, height)
A cylinder (two parameters: radius, height with default height value)
Input Format
Compile time inputs
Output Format
Volumes of cube, rectangle & cylinder.


Solution:
#include<iostream>
#define PI 3.14
class volume1{
public:
double volume(double side){
return side*side*side;
}
double volume(double length,double width,double height){
return length*width*height;
}
double volume(double radius, double height){
return PI*radius*radius*height;
}

int main(){
volume1 v;
double side=3.0;
std::cout<<"volume of the cube with side:"<<side<<" is: "<<v.volume(side)<<std::endl;
double length=4.0,width=5.0,height=6.0;

std::cout<<"volume of the rectangle with

Loan Calculator
For the clients, Bank XYZ need to calculate an education loan and a gold loan. As a result,
they built a loan class with a
loadCalc(). The amount, year, and interest percent are required inputs for calculating an
education loan. The amount and interest
% are necessary inputs for calculating a gold loan. Apply method overloading to calculate
total amount need to be paid for
interest x. Print the monthly amount need to be paid by the client.
Note:
Education loan doesn't have interest upto 4 years. So apply interest if the year is greater than
4, otherwise interest is 0%.
Example1
Input
1
1000
5
2
Output
Amount with interest 1020.0
Explanation

Year greater than 5 , So interest applied .2% of 1000 is 20. So total amount to be paid is
1000+20 =1020
Example2
Input
1
1000
4
2
Output
Amount with interest 1000.0
Explanation
Year less than 5, so interest is not applied. Therefore, total amount to be paid is 1000.

Solution:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Loan {
public:
float total;
void loanCalc(int amount, int year, int interest) {
if (year > 4) {
float x = (amount * (float)(interest / 100.0));
total = x + amount;
} else {
total = amount;
}
}
void loanCalc(int amount, int interest) {

float x = (amount * (float)(interest / 100.0));
total = x + amount;
}
void display() {
cout << "Amount with interest: " << total << endl;
}
};
int main() {
Loan l;
int n;
cout << "Enter 1 for loan calculation with year or 2 for loan calculation without year: ";
cin >> n;
if (n == 1) {
int amount, year, interest;
cout << "Enter amount, year, and interest rate: ";
cin >> amount >> year >> interest;
l.loanCalc(amount, year, interest);
} else if (n == 2) {
int amount, interest;
cout << "Enter amount and interest rate: ";
cin >> amount >> interest;
l.loanCalc(amount, interest);
} else {
cout << "Invalid option!" << endl;
return 1; // Exit with error code
}
l.display();
return 0;

We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an abstract class 'Marks'
with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student B. Create an object for each of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for both the students.
Sample input:
Enter marks for Student A in 3 subjects (out of 100):
85 90 78
Enter marks for Student B in 4 subjects (out of 100):
88 76 92 81
Sample output:
Percentage of Student A: 84.3333%
Percentage of Student B: 84.25%

Solution:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Marks 
{
public:
virtual float getPercentage() = 0;
};

class A : public Marks 
{
private:
float subject1, subject2, subject3;
public:
A(float s1, float s2, float s3) : subject1(s1), subject2(s2), subject3(s3) 
{
}
float getPercentage() override {
return (subject1 + subject2 + subject3) / 3;
}
};
class B : public Marks {
private:
float subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4;

public:
B(float s1, float s2, float s3, float s4) : subject1(s1), subject2(s2), subject3(s3), subject4(s4)
{}
float getPercentage() override {
return (subject1 + subject2 + subject3 + subject4) / 4;
}
};
int main() {
float a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, b4;
cout << "Enter marks for Student A in 3 subjects (out of 100): ";
cin >> a1 >> a2 >> a3;
cout << "Enter marks for Student B in 4 subjects (out of 100): ";
cin >> b1 >> b2 >> b3 >> b4;
A studentA(a1, a2, a3);
B studentB(b1, b2, b3, b4);
cout << "Percentage of Student A: " << studentA.getPercentage() << "%" << endl;
cout << "Percentage of Student B: " << studentB.getPercentage() << "%" << endl;
return 0;

Question:
>>Write a program that demonstrates runtime polymorphism in a payment system.
>>Define a base class Payment with a virtual function pay(double amount) that prints a default payment message.
>>Create three derived classes: CreditCard, UPI, and NetBanking.
>>Each derived class should override the pay() function to show how the amount is paid using that method.
>>In the main() function, use a Payment* pointer to refer to different payment objects and call their pay() methods for a fixed amount (like 500).
>>This will show how the system can handle different types of payments using the same interface.
